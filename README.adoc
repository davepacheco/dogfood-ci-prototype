= dogfood-ci prototype

This repo contains a small Rust program that uses the OAuth2 device authentication flow in the external API to get an authentication token and then makes a request using the token that it got.  It doesn't really do anything else.

The goal is to de-risk the plan to have buildomat use device authn tokens to make requests to our external API.

Prerequisite: start up at least Nexus and probably the rest of the simulated control plane using https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/main/docs/how-to-run-simulated.adoc[the directions here].

Assuming Nexus's external API is running on http://127.0.0.1:12220/, run _this_ program with:

[source,text]
----
cargo run -- http://127.0.0.1:12220
----

You'll be prompted to open a URL in your browser to authenticate using the usual OAuth device flow.
